@par Application Description 

The Gesture Recognition application exploits the Time of Flight sensors to provide an example of a very long and accurate range sensing, directional swipe and tap detection.

After resetting, the firmware:
- configures HAL and clocks
- initializes the LEDs and push buttons
- initializes the Time of Filght sensors
- initializes Gesture Detection Middleware
	- Tap detection
	- Directional swipe detection
- Main loop:
	- Push SW2 button to switch between two demo:
		- Range sensising with LEDs interface
		- Gesture Detection
	- Push PWR button to switch off the system (in case the battery is connected)


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on BlueCoin platform (STEVAL-BCNCS01V1) plugged on CoinStation expansion (STEVAL-BCNST01V1).
    
@par How to use it? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz. IAR, µVision and System Workbench. In order to make the 
program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V7.70).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\Project.eww
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For µVision:
 - Open µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional Version: 5.20).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\Project.uvprojx
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For System Workbench:
 - Open System Workbench for STM32.
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select root directory" and choose the path where the System
   Workbench project is located (SW4STM32)
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
